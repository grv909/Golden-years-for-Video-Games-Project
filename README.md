# Golden-years-for-Video-Games-Project
Our primary objective is to pinpoint a potential "golden age" of video games by identifying release years that garnered high acclaim from both users and critics.
Within this project scope, we'll delve into analyzing critic and user scores alongside sales data for the top
400 video games released since 1977.
Additionally, we'll delve into the business landscape of gaming by examining comprehensive game sales
data.
